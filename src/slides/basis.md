> A UML model consists of three major categories of model elements, each of which may be used to make statements about different kinds of individual things within the system being modeled (termed simply “individuals” in the following). These categories are:  Classifiers. A classifier describes a set of objects. An object is an individual with a state and relationships to other objects. The state of an object identifies the values for that object of properties of the classifier of the object. (In some cases, a classifier itself may also be considered an individual; for example, see the discussion of static structural features in sub clause 9.4.3.)  Events. An event describes a set of possible occurrences. An occurrence is something that happens that has some consequence with regard to the system.  Behaviors. A behavior describes a set of possible executions. An execution is a performance of a set of actions (potentially over some period of time) that may generate and respond to occurrences of events, including accessing and changing the state of objects. (As described in sub clause 13.2, behaviors are themselves modeled in UML as kinds of classifiers, so that executions are essentially modeled as objects. However, for the purposes of the present discussion, it is clearer to consider behaviors and executions to be in a separate semantic category than classifiers and objects.)
